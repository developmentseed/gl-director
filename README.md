# Mapbox camera sandbox

Experiments with the new version of mapbox

## Installation and Usage

The steps below will walk you through setting up your own instance of the project.

### Install Project Dependencies
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (see [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc)) (To manage multiple node versions we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) Package manager

### Install Application Dependencies

If you use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), activate the desired Node version:

```
nvm install
```

Install Node modules:

```
yarn install
```

### Usage

#### Config files
All the config files can be found in `app/assets/scripts/config`.
After installing the projects there will be 3 main files:
  - `local.js` - Used only for local development. On production this file should not exist or be empty.
  - `staging.js`
  - `production.js`

The `production.js` file serves as base and the other 2 will override it as needed:
  - `staging.js` will be loaded whenever the env variable `DS_ENV` is set to staging.
  - `local.js` will be loaded if it exists.

The following options must be set: (The used file will depend on the context):
  - `value` - Description

Example:
```
module.exports = {
  value: 'some-value'
};
```

#### Starting the app

```
yarn serve
```
Compiles the javascript and launches the server making the site available at `http://localhost:9000/`
The system will watch files and execute tasks whenever one of them changes.
The site will automatically refresh since it is bundled with livereload.

# Deployment
To prepare the app for deployment run:

```
yarn build
```
or
```
yarn stage
```
This will package the app and place all the contents in the `dist` directory.
The app can then be run by any web server.
